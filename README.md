# Teletype-Revit-Linker
Provides the interface between the Revit KeynotesRTC add-in and the Teletype
for Atom package. Allows real-time collaboration on Revit keynote files.

You can install this linker through the package manager found under
Settings > Install in the Atom editor.

Since keynote files are tab delimited text files, I recommend the following
settings in Atom:
- Syntax Theme: One Light
- :heavy_check_mark: Settings > Editor > Show Invisibles
- :x: Settings > Editor > Soft Tabs
- :heavy_check_mark: Settings > Editor > Soft Wrap

As of now, the [KeynotesRTC add-in](https://github.com/zachcmathews/keynotesRTC)
for Revit must be installed manually, but I am working on getting the code
signed (to prevent the warning dialogs at startup) and an installer published
on the Revit add-ins store.

Instructions for installation can be found in the
[KeynotesRTC add-in repository](https://github.com/zachcmathews/keynotesRTC).
